I plan on starting a hunt to find a girlfriend who can maintain a high average and is willing to go to university. I have no problem with the fact that I am an only 19 in SE and have no boyfriend I have with the same  IUA as a whole year and a half. But again I am looking for a girlfriend who is willing to go to university and is willing to go to university with me just to satisfy my expectations. At the same time I also need to give my other half of my self a gentle text saying she will be going to school soon,  and I would love to have taken her to uw so that I can start this hunt with her."},
