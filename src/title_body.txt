When I recently returned I was shocked to find it a decaying post-apocalyptic cesspool of whiny incels and beaten to death memes. So here are three potential suggestions that could triple the sub-reddits user engagement across a variety of target demographics with an emphasis on the BIG3 groups. In case you were wondering I run a highly successful web marketing agency that was once declared "an adequate internet marketing agency for small businesses on a budget" by an anonymous Google Maps user. so yes, my opinions matter, so please please take this seriously.

1. **BECOME A BASTION OF TOTAL FREE-SPEECH**: this sub-reddit needs to become a place where you can discuss the most controversial topics imaginable (while still be respectful and affirming of how such issues impact the less privileged. I want people who log on here to get high of the ideas and discussion that take place. this isn't a metaphor I want people to be convulsing on the floor and frothing at the mouth because the discussion that take place on our subreddit fucking blew their mind so wide open they simply couldn't handle it and ascended into a higher plain of being. does that sounds extreme? good, because extreme ideas are what made this USA great.

2. **ESTABLISH A STRICT CODE OF CONDUCT TO ENSURE THIS IS A SAFE SPACE FOR EVERYONE**: You know what's badass? Equity. Respect. Affirmation. Amplifying the voice of our university's least privileged and most marginalized voices (ex. people who applied to management engineering as a first choice). Celebrate the diversity of our campus by recognizing there are other more important voices that need to be heard on this subreddit? Who might those voices be? Anyone but you. :) what does that look like? idk but have you noticed Instagram stories are mostly an endless string of shallow mental health advice paired up with uninspired business art? let's aim for that.

3. **TACO TUESDAYS**: Literally every Tuesday we organize to give everyone student on campus a free taco. like one day someone brings the taco shells, another brings the ground beef (or organic seitan chunks for the vegans), and someone else brings the lettuce.<|endoftext|>fyi for anyone who came to campus today<|endoftitle|>[removed]<|endoftext|>I hate you all, go study<|endoftitle|>Finals start on Friday and you are out here policing my amogus.

I live at 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, u/ConradIsMyDaddy. u/ConradIsMyDaddy has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 4th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career as a UWaterloo student. I was... astounded. I... I always thought u/ConradIsMyDaddy was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time ‚Äì something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. u/ConradIsMyDaddy took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. u/ConradIsMyDaddy had a partner, a businessman named u/CMCAwesome. u/ConradIsMyDaddy sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, u/CMCAwesome threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, u/ConradIsMyDaddy and u/CMCAwesome had a falling-out. Things escalated. u/CMCAwesome was able to arrange ‚Äì uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" ‚Äì on u/ConradIsMyDaddy, and failed, but u/ConradIsMyDaddy was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, u/ConradIsMyDaddy was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Viviek Goel, he plotted to kill u/CMCAwesome. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the campus police, but I was frightened. u/CMCAwesome had risen to become the head of the University of Waterloo. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. \[ u/NudeDudeUWaterloo points to the bruise on his face left by u/CMCAwesome in "Blood Money."\] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that u/CMCAwesome will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this reddit post and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.<|endoftext|>HELP!

I‚Äôm a student in health sciences and I have a lab in the health expansion building once a week. Tuesday on my way to lab, I started hearing boss music coming from somewhere ahead of me. I made it to the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor only to hear the music blaring from right behind me. I turned around and there he was. Orange covid hat man.

I made eye contact with him and his blank stare filled me with dread. I tried pushing the elevator button again but it was no use. The elevator in the expansion building is slower than eduroam wifi. As I was in my frenzied state trying desperately to get in, I failed to notice orange covid hat man slowly approaching me. I turned around and he was staring at me as menacingly as possible for someone who looks like a default mii with glasses. I tried running to the stairwell but he clocked me in the back of the head with his sign saying ‚Äúwear a mask‚Äù. I slowly rolled over to see him now standing over me, blankly staring into my soul. I got goosebumps and my nose started bleeding.

Next thing I know, I‚Äôm waking up in a body bag and the smell of rotting corpses is overpowering my sensory system. I start kicking looking for a way out but there‚Äôs no use. Nothing is working. I checked my phone and 2 days have elapsed. I just looked at my location on Google maps and it says I‚Äôm still in the health expansion building. If I were to guess, I‚Äôm probably in a cadaver lab somewhere in one of the body bags but I can‚Äôt tell for sure. Please if one of you reading this could try and help get me out of here. I‚Äôm hungry and thirsty and am covered in my own bodily waste. My phone is at 7% as I type this so this may be my last contact with the outside world.

So my friend starting going out with this girl recently, they've been together for about two months. She's a graduate from the good old University of Waterloo engineering department, and apparently was fairly active on the dating scene during undergrad. Now, I'll be honest, I didn't go to this school. All I really know is the... reputation this faculty has. You know, "Cali or Bust", blockchain enthusiasts, 8000 hours on League, willing to sell the family dog for a Tesla co-op, that sort of thing. She was around these sorts of people for at least 4 years; interacting with them, studying with them, possibly even dating some of them. This clearly took a significant toll.

You see, my friend is also an engineering grad of a different, but comparable, university. He's not, historically, what you'd consider a "ladies man". Not COMPLETELY hopeless, but he has his red flags. One of those red flags is Overwatch. He plays it with people in our friend group a lot. Almost every single night, for several hours. So much Overwatch, in fact, that there is a heated running discussion on who's kill-stealing the most vs. who's getting their kills stolen the most. To solve this discussion, they started saving their stats from each game (# of kills, damage, etc.) and have it all stored in a spreadsheet. They have performed statistical analysis on this data. There are graphs showing who's getting their kills stolen the most. They have arguments about how to interpret the data. Looking at it makes all of those "Young Male Virginity on the Rise" headlines make sense.

Now, a few days ago, my friend invited the girl over to watch movies and cuddle. Up until this point, they hadn't been intimate yet, hadn't even made out. It's also worth mentioning that my friend had NO intention of initiating sex that night. They made popcorn, watched the movie, all in all a standard date night. Once the movie's over, he's struggling for conversation topics. So, the spaghetti starts falling out and he starts talking about fucking Overwatch. This devolves into what I can only assume is a feral rant about his kills getting stolen. He even shows her the fucking graphs and charts.

This turned her on. They had sex that night.

The engineering department at this godless university produced a woman that gets turned on statistical analysis of Overwatch games. What kind of monsters do this? How many rants about cryptocurrencies has this woman had to listen to during her first dates with her classmates? How many anime analysis videos has she been forced to watch while cuddling in bed? Not only has she been completely desensitized to this sort of thing, she gets aroused by it. I mean, if her bar for arousal is "Overwatch damage charts", what's the bar for disinterest? Or disgust? Whatever culture this engineering department has, whatever you people did, it got my friend laid. I'm equally amazed and horrified by you guys, so either keep it up or stop it immediately.<|endoftext|>What‚Äôa up w AFM students stereotypes?

The first time I ate lunch wearing my Grainger CS shirt (with fully covered legs, mind you), I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 3 months and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last MP. Girl, I don't struggle with MPs. I'm a CS major, not CS+X. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate in the ISR bathroom, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest program on campus (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).

The worst are when students from non-technical majors talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: "What's your major?" As soon as I say those two magnificent letters, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes an art major think they have a chance with me. FAA and Grainger are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that paints happy little trees for "work."

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in ECE (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in the world in Destiny 2. My gray shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Rick and Morty with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout "pickle rick" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3. Not that I cried.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the ECE majors are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding CS + X though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was an ECE major, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next Facebook. Seductively touching Grainger Bob isn't going to make me want to get with you. Come back in a Morty costume, code a Y combinator, or implement Djikstra's recursively, and then we'll talk.<|endoftext|>Are humans randomly generated NPCs?<|endoftitle|>ok ok hear me out

Is it just me, or do random strangers you see on the internet, the streets, or in the hallways have similar faces to other strangers you have seen before, so often that it seems like there are different "types" of human faces in terms of the facial structure and hairstyle? It's as if everyone is generated randomly from a pool of NPCs like I could look at some random guy and say that they look like "human male #14" and that I've seen people who look like that about a hundred times before already.

I would like to thank every member of the nude dude tribe for the incredible support we've seen since the post went live, love you all üíõ . The nude dude run will be going ahead on **March 15th at the SLC food court**. As of right now it is planned to happen at 2pm but this may be subject to change. There have also been some concerns about the run being an act of public indecency, and I would like to assure you all that I will be taking every measure to avoid criminal charges and to protect my identity.

Also, since we hit our 200 upvote goal so fast, there's going to be a bonus challenge. If the original nude dude post gets **500 UPVOTES** I will hold a sign that reads the text from the top voted comment on either the original post or this post.

Hello r/UWaterloo ! My name is Nude Dude, and I have decided to set up a challenge of sorts for the members of this subreddit, with a prize of course.  On March 15, 2022 I have an event planned, but this event can only happen if the challenge is successfully completed.

The challenge is as follows, if this post can reach **200 UPVOTES** by 11:59pm EST on March 14th, I will run **NAKED** through SLC at 2pm EST the following day. 

In case of an investigation by any federal entity or similar, I do not have any involvement with the nude dude group or with the people in it, I do not know how I am here, probably added by a third party, I do not support any actions by the members of this group. 

But in all seriousness to avoid this post being taken down by Rule 2, the run may have to be modified to wearing nothing but a damp sock on my willy. By not being *completely* nude, the challenge would not be an illegal activity and this post cannot be taken down.

For my closing remarks, I would like to wish all the members of r/UWaterloo the best of luck in achieving the 200 upvote goal and good luck with the rest of the W22 term.

Also if I was working a shift and decided to heat up my food during a break it‚Äôs okay but this isn‚Äôt because????? It‚Äôs still my mfkn food coming from my mfkn house.

unlesss??!?!??<|endoftext|>cake day...<|endoftitle|>i am getting old  
[my first post üò≥](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/819zg4/cs350_crying_thread/dv1tmk1/)<|endoftext|>Hello World<|endoftitle|>By the time you get to the end of this transmission, I hope to provide you with a solution to the geopolitical crisis that is unfolding in Ukraine. 

Also perhaps, a solution to all of the problems that I see in the world where the relations to others, to the earth, to the plants, the animals and the universe are failing. 

First let me begin with my background. 

I am an intergalactic being with the intent of bringing peace to you silly humans. LOL NOT.

I am a human from Earth and I found some insights that I couldn‚Äôt hold in, so I felt the need to share them. I know it‚Äôs the right thing to do. I owe all of my ideas to the collective experience that everyone has created. 

How would you end the following sentence? We are at war with the greatest adversary that we have ever had, ¬≠¬≠\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (noun). How would you answer this question? What is it that you wish to put in the blank? Could it be adequately filled with our own name? Could it be adequately filled with the term *ourselves*? We have allies with the greatest collection of nukes against an enemy with the other greatest collection of nukes. We are pointing our guns at each other. Our friends are killing their friends. If you are a human in this war, you are fighting other humans. They are your friends. They are your family. They are like you.  It is a tragic, disgusting, vile situation that is only amplified each second it continues. We hear constant updates of the reported number of deaths and casualties of "civilians", "soldiers", "separatists", "Russian forces", "opposing forces", "Ukrainian forces" ‚ÄúNATO forces‚Äù we hear these terms, and it makes us feel hatred for the enemy that does not exist. Whatever the terms, hatred is not what is works.

THESE ARE THE STAKES. WE MUST EITHER LOVE EACH OTHER OR WE MUST DIE.

Woo boy those are some powerful words‚Ä¶ who said them? Not me, some old timey voice in a video I saw. It is good to hear these also:

THERE IS NO PLACE TO ESCAPE TO.  THIS IS THE LAST STAND ON EARTH. 

Unless you get in a rocket ship and go to the International Space Station or the moon. That is how high we are escalating the situation. We are figuratively ascending into outer space with our actions, our words and above all, our thoughts. 

Do you wonder why the speeches we write in secret with our allies sound great, then once we present them to the word it no longer has the same effect? No one seems to believe us; the effect just wasn‚Äôt there?

We are only capable of being heard if we are truly convicted of our beliefs. When we are true to our core, our soul and we know in our heart of hearts that what we are doing is working and we were right in our convictions. Not a sliver of doubt. Not 99.9999999% but 100%. 1/1. It does not mean shutting down dissention, it means embracing disagreement. 

What does all of this mean? What do I think the solution is? 

WELL, WE‚ÄôRE WAITING you say. (insert meme imagery here)

Surrender. Both sides. All sides if there are more than two. Put down your guns. Don‚Äôt shoot ever again in a way that causes harm to others. Be righteous. Follow what your soul is telling you. Follow what you know is right. What you are trembling to do. When you stop crying it is because you found resolve. Those are tears of joy. 

Let me channel your mother for a second: I DON‚ÄôT CARE WHOS FAULT IT IS, KNOCK IT OFF.

Just in case it wasn‚Äôt clear. (=\^.\^=) :P

You may face the same opposition when you tell this to others who did not read along with you here today, but you may feel the conviction of ‚ÄúI knew it all along‚Äù because it is so obvious. That is the beauty of a perfect solution, it is so easy. This is what some call hindsight bias. It is because of our learned fallacies and biases that are unconscious but take some effort to bring to the forefront of our minds. Once you know, you know. It is about knowledge, understanding, love, compassion, respect, and a literal infinity of other words that you can come up with yourself. 

TL;DR Be nice. Surrender. Love thy neighbour, especially if they seem like an enemy. To stop killing, stop killing. To stop shooting, stop pulling the trigger. To stop war, stop fighting, start loving. The synonyms and the use of allegory can be endless, languages evolve, but the spirit remains. We are all imperfect, so stop striving for perfection. It should not be the goal, it just happens. 

Utopia exists and here we are‚Ä¶We are fighting over lines on a map, and we brought our school yard antics for solving problems to adulthood where we have bigger toys worth fighting over and bigger stones to throw around. The solution is to simply put down the rocks and to respect each other while looking for a solution. 

TL;DR TL;DR Surrender. Let‚Äôs taco-bout it.

r u lonely, r u virgin, r ur celibacy is proof by definition? 
 you tried of crying alone in you bed having no one to send your 85% dark chocolate to on valentines day?   are you just exist in the world, waiting for the day you book yourself in hospice alone and the only thing to comfort you is that robot thing that slowly stroking your arm as you slowly drift out consciousness, wonder how life will be different if Â∞èËéâ from highschool didn't laugh u out of room in front of everyone for being a manlet when u say u like her..  but now as you reach to the other side then realize your name isn't even writing on book of life from the low church attendance? yes i am all of above. if u anything like me i got some gud news cus i am going tell you some techniques on how to get uw women and be chad based off my 3 am brainworms. 

1. first before even our sigma male grindset in. i have remind u the code. the code? don't fuck with bros' girl, never cock block a bro either. if your bros r down bad, have naloxone ready. never snitch on your bro but set him straight if he capping to you. remember Leviticus 18:22 *You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination*. that why you always be based and speak in truth in front of your fellow brothers but not with woman. even the good book says so.  look out for female bros too when you male bros being creepy. never flex on your bro if he's a cel.   remember bro before hoes. you can always buy new dirt tiller from home hardware but the buddy who willing go fish trip with you to papua new guinea and share oxy with you is irreplaceable. even even u got no frens like me, u follow the code 

2. this is the reminder to drink water. in person is here, people are gotta to notice our fragrance wen we not shower for awhile but it's ok. because drinking water is more important. you can drink water wen shower too but preferably dasani while reading imprint.

4. sorry for the ad break... i was doomed on relationship in general still am. but what i realize is that gf cant be the source of happiness in your life. the anime romance is a meme. as /u/TheVerifiedPost said happy have to come with in. gf can't fix you, nor be the only source of your happiness, nor your other half, nor completes you. they can't be our crouch no matter how much we long 4. you have to fix and complete yourself first. once you find ur own source of happiness. you able to figure out what u wanna out of a relationship what kind of gf u want.  or else u getting yourself into some weird codependent relationship where she ditch you for a chad once you run out of stuff to offer and then u rope. with a health mindset and realistic goel to be the drive for you to succeed.  same goes for cali too. 

5. dem here the 4 pills. normies would be white, blue, black or red pill you. those are bullshit the real 4 pills fellow anons are **product, price, place, promotion**.  **product**. this involes market research,like red green said if you woman don't find you handsome be handy but if you can't be both u get a phd in psych and write rules for life. like i have a lot of thing make me unattractive, like height and being aisan but i try to compensate by gymmax and funnimax.  if you are chad you are good for general market.  but if not you need figure out what kind of niche that's best suit for strength.  once u find your potential customer. its time for product developing and refinement.     i recommend cs455-cs457 to help u with those. **price**, what price you willing to pay for the simping? buy her a house? buy her a car? be her trophy daddy if u are a chad?  also mind that price the girl have to pay to be with you while there so many gigachads around. what so special about u to worth her? how much time and attention she willing to put to you? **place** is where u try to meet ur girl, tinder? in bars? since dis is uwaterloo so i would say piazza/ also you might have to go to places like be the next president idk.  the last p is **promotion** no one will know you are 6'4 sigma chad if you don't express your big dick energy. rn the meta seem to me is to clout chase on socials. you gain a lot clout by living in icon with cali money, bench 400 pound. posting green frogs on reddit. making a lot irl frens 2 be ur wing person and eating down 9 line of lazeez in one go.  

6. if you are feeding geese wen lonely pls do not feed junk food like i used to. i recently learn starch is very unhealthy. a better option is lettuce, seeds and peels. also don do it too often or they forget to touch grass.  also the 9 pm spot at waterloo park is taken sorry. 

7. is okay if it never happened, i always thought i am loser for being a loner but most male in history never get laid for their entire lives either. most of them died as baby but for many they lived or die in war or some shit, but some find their own happiness and friendship on the journey. even we robots considered disposable by society we be like those army ant building and defending the colony of humanity.  buddha said some shit about letting go and cutting attachment to ease suffering. whatever that zen stuff is just use that as cope or roblox. either way i do low key needing that /comfy/ robot arm rn tho.

8. if you go gymmaxxing pls wipe the handles covid is over but the flu remains. 

alright i capped, i don know how 2 find gf this whole thing is just a long reeee

The results are in!<|endoftitle|>WATERLOO, ON ‚Äì Tensions have been flaring ever since an anonymous account posted a letter, allegedly sent via university administration to staff about delaying the start of the in-person Winter 2022 term. It was later revealed that the letter was fabricated, but it seems as though it touched a nerve in the student body of the University of Waterloo.

Aggregating data collected from posts, comments, polls, and other interactions on Reddit, the reporters at $MEDIA_CONGLOMERATE have formed an opinion poll on the consensus of the students on this contentious issue. The results are in, and they are clear.

Nearly every single person in this university wants (online/in-person) classes to continue, as (alleged by the letter/scheduled by the university). The reasons behind this nearly unanimous stance are numerous, with among the most cited being (not having found a winter sublet/having found a winter sublet), preferring (online/in-person) classes for the (flexible schedule/real-life interaction), and various other reasons.

There is a vocal minority, however, seeking to twist the narrative and make it seem like (in-person/online) is the preferred choice. The reporters were able to investigate and find that these (antivax/cheating) agents seek to subvert the greater good of the university for their own benefit. The reader may rest assured that these insurgent agents have been reported to the relevant authorities and are being tracked down by the Geese Police as we speak.

We at $MEDIA_CONGLOMERATE will continue to bring you the latest updates on this topic, so stay tuned.<|endoftext|>winter 2022 online when<|endoftitle|>when is it my turn for full in-person classes üò≠<|endoftext|>Winter 2092 online?<|endoftitle|>it should be online because of the new ligma variant.<|endoftext|>Remember the good ol days<|endoftitle|>Pre-covid, in 2019.

Once again, after three months, I am being forced to leave the safe confines of my parents snugly basement. The room feels desolate ‚Äì like a kingdom without its king, a katana without the samurai. I muster all my courage to move my apparently ‚Äòdiabetic‚Äô leg over the door ledge; my head appears to pop out of the door to scan the surroundings like that of a turtle emerging out of its shell. I‚Äôve become disillusioned with the governments efforts to inject my body with chemicals. Who knows, maybe I‚Äôd turn gay like the frogs did? Anyway, the basement was a musky, warm safe haven for me. The ruffle of half-eaten Doritos, the drip of a spilled mountain dew, the smell of two week old stained underwear ‚Äì all of it combined to make it a safe space feel like home. IT was bliss ‚Äì it was life. That was all I knew; that was all I believed in. I liked it when my farts lightly fluttered the nearby empty Lay‚Äôs packet. The quiet crinkle of the packet reminds me of the way an alpha Chad rips open a condom packet. The smell of bowels engulfed my taste buds and my nostrils - a smell that I knew she would love. Her plush cotton body, all stretched and stained with varying tones of white, yellow, and red ‚Äì perhaps a smudge a brown?


The door creaks open. My erect penis emerges, then my hip, 1 inch later. My mom tells me it is big, but I have reservations for it barely fills the bowels of my girl. Regardless, what right does a woman that gets rammed by 10 inches of alpha chad each day have to talk to me. I linger in the doorway. My slightly swollen ‚Äúdiabetic‚Äù left foot emerges from the pit of my room. It shudders the floorboards as it steps down. I hear a nail give way to the pressure. My dog Dorito-san whimpers at the sight of being emerging. He disgraces me by running up the stairs. Like a silent ninja, I bring my right foot onto the floor. My foot wobbles as my weight descends upon it. A striking pain shoots up my leg as it complains about the 70lbs I gained over the last 3 weeks on my keto diet of pizza with no crust in an effort to become healthy. I fall to my knees, my groin sloshing against my thighs. I sigh a breath of relief for I have finally accomplished my parents wishes. I silently roll back into the safe void of my pillow harem.<|endoftext|>Fuck PD<|endoftitle|>Having to deal with the fucking PD 10 must pass final assignment after a long day with lack of sleep made me figuratively punch my desk and point middle finger at my computer screen<|endoftext|>Are you allowed to do courses while in prison?<|endoftitle|>I'm pretty desparate to find housing for next term.

if someone posts horny in my nnn threads accidentally without malice i would be asking them politely that its nov and we don't appreciate the temptations. but if they did it repeatedly. or did it as bait. i would goto a second step and retaliate in kind: 

instead of bonking when the damage was already being done my strat is:

*if they post straight porn i will post gay porn, if they post gay porn i will post straight porn.* ***no one is going to leave this place with a boner.***

but if they realize their mistake and post nonhorny again then i will also post nonhorny and forgive the transgressors. 

repeat until dec 1. 


this lg~~b~~t inclusive strat will hopefully keep my soldiers clean.

This sub never gets tired of this bit.

[day 8]<|endoftitle|>i should of tell u that reason 4 no nut at the beginning. mods is like stop dis [serious] tag reee its no dealing with anything school-related reeee

last year i did shitpost that i am doing nnn but to be honest i failed at 1 am... i have no friends nor ppl interested on nnn so its moot doing this by myself. 

this time is for serious tho. despite we might be continents away. there is something we can do together 

at the beginning there no noble goal or purpose either, nnn was a meme challenge.  i did it cus i found enough ppl on discord that are willing to do it together.. but i am weak-willed, the longest streak i ever did was like 10 days... my regrets and self-hate can only go so far...

so i draw on something stronger.

nnn is an analogy of a journey that we part take in this uni. we celebrate the ones who beat this challenge but so many tried and failed.    i have seen so many people who made their exit statement on here. or people who failed everything and made their last cry.  if you remember that famous goodbye letter a few months ago. but sadly there is so much more without the same replies and attention.  most of them only made one or few posts then disappears. and then the community forgets about them.. those posts become the worn-out tombstones of unknown soldiers you find in the wild. i know i will be one of them. eventually, forgotten. 

i don't think it's appropriate for me to list them but you easily search them up.   i personally saved more than half a dozen of those sad posts i encounter over the years. hoping for a happy update, a good ending that never comes.  

this is probably the first and last nnn i ever do with the boys. so i dedicate every day as a remembrance to each of those who didn't quite make it on the journey.  &gt;!for my future self as well.!&lt; till then they are remembered. at least by sad froge the reee.<|endoftext|>To whoever left the urinal unflushed in the E5 men's washroom, by the gear lab<|endoftitle|>Your urine tastes unnaturally sweet.

**House details:** Bathroom and kitchen are shared, and you will have to book a time at https://tendstofortytwo.tk/reservations before using (with 48 hours notice). Requests may be denied for any reason. 

**Other:** I will provide a catgirl costume that you will have to wear at all times while at home. You are also not allowed to exit the basement, and will in fact be shackled to the room floor. To go outside you must also book a reservation at the above URL. I would prefer that you wear the catgirl costume while outside as well, but given suitable reasons (interview, etc) that can be waived. You will be provided with a GPS tracker if you choose to go outside without the costume on (the costume contains one as well), which you must not remove while outside. There may be other requirements for you while in your catgirl suit, which will be detailed in the sublease document. If the catgirl suit does not match your gender identity, please let us know a few months in advance so we can arrange a catsuit suitable for your gender.

**Utilities:** You are allowed to turn on the light in the basement if that does not conflict with the wishes of the ~~master~~ landlord. Usage of this light and any water used in the kitchen or washroom is free of charge, but subject to a Fair Usage Policy described in the lease document.

One night they hosted an Indian themed dinner (they typically had two dinner themes, this time one of them was Indian). 

I decided it give their butter chicken a try, and by all means...I believe this butter chicken was more insulting to the subcontinent of India than the entirety British subjugation. To make it worse, it had green peppers in it...once I noticed that it was like my taste buds were hit by Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the same time. 

Back in the day, 'cultural appropriation' was a contentious topic. I don't believe that someone should be cancelled for trying to get involved or experience a culture as an outsider, but the butter chicken I tasted that day was the most white washed shit that's ever touched my tongue.... literally no spice. It was evil. V1 should give the RoySoulChild Indian Music club reparations for this act.

As we all know, democracy is limited. It's a cool idea but it also kinda sucks. As history has shown time and time again, dictators are based. They're more efficient, literally, no one suffers, and they're never power-hungry. If you could pick on a dictator (including monarchs, emperors, tzars, Ceasars, and any autocratic ruler) from all of history to stan (or elect into power using a democratic system)...who would it be? 

For me, it's easy, Napoleon Bonaparte. He's the closest thing we've got to a real-life Naruto.<|endoftext|>5 ways to get uw women and be chad -by UW Chad<|endoftitle|>Are you lonely? Are you a virgin? Are you tired of waking up to being alone in your bed? Probably, because you are a Waterloo student who runs away like a pussy everytime those geese hiss at you to see your reaction. One of ussss. Well I got good news for you, because I am going to tell you my techniques on how to get uw women and be chad based off facts, research, and experience.

1. Go to the CIF gym like a chad.
     Tired of being that nerd who smells like they haven't showered in 2 weeks? Well, guys like us have that smell because we all have that hidden alpha gene in our body that's waiting to shine. And girls love that shit they love alpha gene. So hit the CIF gym like the chad you are and get buff get gains get ALPHA.

2. Buy microsoft merch.
     UW women love microsoft merch. Get microsoft merch. Not sponsored.

3. Live at Icon
    Icon is alpha and you can see people fucking through the glass windows at night (fun tip). Also next to Gongcha and all uw women love gongcha. 

4. When the geese hiss at you, assert your dominance by hissing back.
    You don't want to be that uw pussy who runs everytime they see a geese. You have that inner chad in you that knows they are alpha chad. When the geese hiss at you be a man and hiss back. 
    When the geese hiss at you, hiss back.
    When the geese poop at you, poop back. (Daily reminder to poop today btw).

5. Have good posture.
     You pussy nerds sit in front of your computer all day destroying your posture. Sit upright and do that ergonomics or whatever to get good posture.

If all else fails then just pretend to go super saiyan since everyone here is a weeb including the women and you will probably attract fellow uw people by going super saiyan.

I know this advice will help some fellow uw nerds out there who have all the potential to become chad like me. You got this and goodluck.

Yours Truly,

UW Chad<|endoftext|>it's oct 1, on this special day...<|endoftitle|>4chan turned 18

It has been 21 years since the first episode of Dora the Explorer aired and yet Dora, the Explorer remains a pop culture icon and an inspiration to many. (Wilt, 2021) Dora, and her friend Boots, go on quests to faraway lands and solve problems they encounter on the way. The objective is to prove that Dora is the most iconic explorer. The following reflection uses the episode "Dora in Troll Land" to analyze Dora's iconicness and reflects on how society would be better if we all learnt from her. 

**Critical Reflection - Dora in Troll Land**

The episode starts with a peppy theme song "Do-do-do-do-Dora" where Dora clearly establishes dominance and stands out with peak main character energy. She swings on a vine, greets her friends, kicks a football into oblivion, rides a unicorn and prevents Swiper from swiping all in the span of 30 seconds making her a person who flourishes in a fast-paced environment. The most distinctive character trait Dora displays is being a good listener. Every time she asks a question, she pauses to let the other person collect their thoughts and come up with a response while maintaining eye contact to convey confidence and conviction. ("10 Reasons Eye Contact Is Everything in Public Speaking", 2021)

In the selected episode, Boots and Dora invite the viewers to accompany them and their group of friends to a playground that is located across the troll bridge. When the posse reaches the bridge and cannot seem to find the troll required to cross the bridge they ask Dora, thereby implying that Dora is an efficient problem solver. She has no problem acknowledging that she is unaware of his location instead of trying to come up with excuses, inspiring us to be upfront. Hearing the "grumpy old troll" in trouble, Dora and Boots teleport to Troll Land. This is a girl that does not let any obstacles stand in her way and goes above and beyond to accomplish her goals. With excellent navigation skills, they find the path to be: bowl, toll, pole, goal, hole (a classic Friday night). On her way, she is seen to be extremely observant and manages to fix a racecar, a sailboat, a train while leveraging them to reach her first destination (cereal *bowl*) and without missing a single rhyme, truly poetic. Rowing through the milk on a berry using a spoon, Dora, an athletic wonder, demonstrates agility and strength. Muy bien! When she reaches the toll, she has all the 6 + 2 coins needed to pass through. This indicates Dora did indeed "make bank" ("Urban Dictionary: Make Bank", 2021) during her co-op terms, a true girl boss. She makes the unique choice of selecting the path with frogs over dogs, she is confident in her judgement and does not let social stigma keep her away from the pole. Moving over to the next hurdle, our bilingual queen immediately deciphers that she needs to score 3 goals to make it across. Dora does not let the goalie's underestimation of her abilities affect her gameplay and focuses on *pateando el bal√≥n* (she also gives the viewers a quick lesson in Spanish). Finally, they reach the tight magic hole where the troll is stuck. She figures out the magic rhyme to get the troll out: tomatoes and cheese, potatoes and bees, and most importantly teaches the viewers to have manners and the significance of the magic word "please". This gets the troll out of the hole and allows everyone to access the playground. Dora is not one to downplay her achievements and celebrates with a song, "We did it". 

Dora is industrious and tenacious and rises up to any kind of challenge she is presented with. Besides her intelligence, she is also gifted with an impeccable sense of style. The pink top paired with orange shorts demonstrates an excellent understanding of colour theory and as they say - you can never go wrong with bangs. It is safe to conclude that Dora is truly the most iconic Exploradora and it is impossible to compete with a girl of that caliber.

I guess if I wanted a lighter workload I should have gone to laurier instead. or maybe applied for something easier like computer engineering instead of an academically rigorous program like afm. maybe I should do cfm? that way I can still study finance and get a good nyc coop while also wasting some time writing useless code that doesn't contribute anything to society. but I also dont want to be judged being a CE or cfm student. they dont shower. I should have gone to york.<|endoftext|>SCI206 IS HARD!<|endoftitle|>Just coming here to complain after bombing my first quiz and getting 66%<|endoftext|>COVID Vaccine :(<|endoftitle|>My cousin won‚Äôt get the vaccine cuz his friend got it &amp; became impotent.

 I don't think my don did anything which kinda pisses me off. I want to make sure nobody is happy in REV this year because I hate laughter, nobody deserves to laugh because I wasn't popular in high school. I prefer consooming at night quietly.

What's the most effective way of reporting and making other people less happy?

We no longer have any posts complaining about the smell on campus. 

Prior to online school, there would be at least a few posts each and every term complaining about the stench in MC, the reeking ECE kids, basically begging people to take showers and put on deodorant. As we return to campus, I hope to see these posts return and blow up our sub once again. 

God speed ECE. God speed. 

Aside: I remember someone suggesting the University place deodorant stations around campus once, that is a genius idea. I wouldn't opt out of that fee. I think, if anything, the stench is going to be worse whenever we return, I know people who stopped showering daily during COVID...and I don't think they'll stop.

Unfortunately, I have gotten rejected from Hack the North every time for the past 4 years. Thus, these questions have made me incredibly sad and I hope that I get to experience the feeling of conforming to social expectations of a software engineering student at some point before my graduation in 2 years.

Please help updoot this for internet clout so that the people organizing Hack the North see and accept my application. Thank you &lt;3<|endoftext|>You've heard of the pomodoro technique, but have you heard about the omelete technique?<|endoftitle|>When I first started at UW, I was struguling to find a studying method that worked for me. I tried using the pomodoro technique but I found that every time I left and tried to come back, I would have a hard time concentrating again. I figured this was because I would often be in the middle of a task when the alarm went off and it would take me a while to pick up where I left off.

That is why I created the omelet technique. This is an improved form of the pomodoro technique that solved all the problems I had with the original method. It works like this:

First, be slightly lactose intolerant. Not to the degree where you will completely dispose of the contents of your stomach imediately, but enough so that you will be going back and forth to the bathroom after having some dairy.

Second, Get an omelete with A LOT of chese. I usually preffer to get mozzarella but use whatever works for you.

Third, start a task after eating your omelet and you will notice your body will need to go to the bathroom every 20 minutes or so. The breaks are usually pretty short but will continue throughout the day. 

Unlike the pomodoro technique, the alarm for the omelete technique is gradual, so you get a warning that time is running out about 5 minutes before break time. This is great for pacing yourself and allows you to develop better time management skills since you can pace yourself better like this. Also, since there is no buzzer, you can hold it in for a few minutes past the deadline if you're strong enough to get those extra minutes you need to finish that tedious task once and for all.

Let me know if the omelet method works for you and what type of cheese works best!<|endoftext|>Why do I keep getting Farmer's Wrap coupons every week<|endoftitle|>Cuz I'm in FARM  \*crack up\*<|endoftext|>nee how<|endoftitle|>üá®üá≥ #1 in olympics fuck u usa fuck u russia<|endoftext|>Kanye is literally writing his work term report last minute right now<|endoftitle|>Fuck PD.<|endoftext|>INTERVIEW TO UNRANKED SPEED RUN | ANY %<|endoftitle|>&amp;#x200B;

There were 2 dudes just talking, one of them I  could barely understand and I had to ask him to repeat himself but he  got upset about that. The second guy seemed nice but he was kinda  stupid. They asked me stuff about my resume and the stuff listed there.  One dude ended up asking me about certain design patterns and software  architecture, after telling him about it he said I was wrong (even  though I was right). Basically they asked me stuff like "Why do you want  to work for RBC?" and other generic interview shit, then they moved  onto stuff about my resume and they were doubting it the whole time  despite me having the github repos listed. I offered to walk him through  my code if he was too stupid to understand and the dude seemed angry.  They ended it off with a "leetcode" question that wasn't even leetcode,  the guy just wanted me to give an algorithm to solve a problem he made.  Thing is, the dude legit could not understand my algorithm and I even  tried to draw diagrams and explain stuff visually. I asked them if they  could see my screen when I first started sharing screens and they said  they could, 5 minutes later they said they haven't been able to see my  screen the whole time. When time was running out the bad english dude  asked me if I had any questions and I asked him "how did you get  hired?", he seemed upset and then told me "I can tell you're angry for  failing this interview so badly". I told him I wasn't angry and was  happy that I don't have to work for RBC for the rest of my life. He  started calling me the nword and the homophobic fword despite it being Pride Month. I then hung up the call but then 5 minutes later my phone  was ringing. I picked it up and it was the interviewer who I couldn't  understand calling me the nword again. Overall, RBC is dogshit if you  have some experience, if you don't then it's an okay job. I disliked the  interview and I don't want to work there as a result of it, but your  experience may vary.<|endoftext|>I will turn into a convertible<|endoftitle|>[removed]<|endoftext|>FUCK LAZEEZ<|endoftitle|>[removed]<|endoftext|>another "I defecated explosive Lazeez diarrhea during my video interview." shitpost<|endoftitle|>Feeling some shit like that may get posted soon.

Nobody asked for this, but I am here to present to you my final post on this subreddit as I must now attend UofT now to complete my final academic journey (not saying what I am doing, but it's professional school cause I don't need first years asking me a million questions). I am thus going to delete this account (probably not, ngl) so that I cannot become distracted as my mission requires immediate attention, but I must share important advice for incoming first years and the second years who never got to experience the glory that is campus.

In my experience, the best washrooms on campus are the following:

Chemistry 2/C2, the entrance near MC, it's a glass door that leads to a stairwell and another door. Choose the other door and take a left turn. The perfect washroom to use when number #2 is coming hard and fast, cause barely anyone uses this washroom in my experience. This place was my safe space during undergrad, ngl.

DC, the second floor has some pretty quiet washrooms. They're just a floor above the regular DC washrooms (where the next pandemic will probably spawn). Kind of tight and unpleasant but not bad.

Some of E6/7/8 or whatever have good quiet washrooms and one of them has showers in case your roommates are hogging the showers.

Washrooms to avoid:

The washrooms in DC library. Just literal vomit inducing. Literally had shit smeared on the walls once.

The washrooms in SLC. One word: Nasty.

SCH and SLC washrooms constantly have someone lurking around. Not a good place for number two.

Study spots:

DP 7th floor. Spent a semester hiding here trying to avoid roommates. Was pretty good and usually has a spot even during finals. I always went if I absolutely needed to study during finals. Lots of weird stuff written on the desks too. 7/10.

Renison college. Decent little library and the cafeteria has outlets too, can usually find a study spot. 6/10.

SLC upstairs. I usually found study spots here however it's not good during finals. Too many people and no spots. 5/10.

Funcken Cafe. I like it. Coffee is available and you can usually get a spot and has decent outlets. Not sure what it's like during finals because I'm too lazy to walk that far usually. 5/10.

St Jerome's new building facing the health centre. Not a bad spot, usually found a study spot here. Usually there are round tables with decent plastic chairs, nothing fancy but there's outlets.

Overall, lecture rooms tend to be good if everywhere you go is full.

DC library sucks for finals unless you get there before 10 am. After that, good luck. Might be able to find a dank, musty spot in the basement though. Positives are that it's close to Tim Hortons, MC, and the plaza.<|endoftext|>LPT: Ask Dr Fauci for a job/grad school letter of recommendation<|endoftitle|>Apparently this man responds thoughtfully to every email he gets, even those from complete strangers.

I was looking at unis and really wanna do something with computer coding because I wanna make video games when I grow up. I saw Waterloo software eng and it seems really cool and all but I've heard lots of stories about how the geese on campus can be very scary. for that reason I'm thinking about going to Brock for CS so I can make video games for my favorite companies like Call of Duty and Fortnite. Is there anyone in Waterwoo who's a veteran in handling the geese that can speak to this issue? my favorite companies have coops here but I'm afraid the geese might scare them away üòî<|endoftext|>FLYING INTO SPACE LIKE A ROCKET NEVER GIVING UP<|endoftitle|>[removed]<|endoftext|>Bruh<|endoftitle|>Bruh<|endoftext|>you ain't ever gotten a hoe preggers?<|endoftitle|>Is that cuz you use connies or does you fire blanks?<|endoftext|>who else got rejected from transfering to cs this year<|endoftitle|>[removed]<|endoftext|>CS transfer<|endoftitle|>&lt;p&gt;Hey all, I was curious what you thought my chances of transferring from Honours Math into CS are?

And I'm finishing up a Masters right now, so I know how to formulate an argument. But they still failed me, twice, and 8 years on I'm still salty.

We at CEE have been pressuring President Biden to provide a trillion dollar stimulus to reinvigorate the US economy to create more jobs for UW co-op students. More developments will follow.

this is all i wanted to say, i'm leaving in the summer to come back. i always loved canada as my home and i knew it was always a safe zone for me. i was never wrong of that, especially now since i've gotten experience of what it's like to go to an international private school from 6-12 grade and have to see most of the same people for the last 7 years, i know that i will never come back here ever again because it is seriously not worth your money, your time, your effort or mental health.<|endoftext|>Our rough economic situation is making me thankful for choosing U of T rather than UWaterloo<|endoftitle|>Get it?

No, [redacted].

Who are you? Let me guess. A freak. STEM Student. You looked down on your peers at your stupid little Mississauga high school (they're all happier than you right now by the way).

"Oooh, I know what a java is! Have you heard of pi? It equals e! Oh em gee, elon musk is epic!"

You don't have any clue what you're doing. You grew up in an artificial suburb within 30 minutes of downtown Toronto, your parents or your grandparents came to Canada from some jungle or desert or, God forbid, Eur*pe ü§Æ, and your entire life has been a cookie cutter example of what life should be with cartoons and social media from America getting Wunderwaffed through your beady little eyes into your rotting brain.

"Mr Post... You're rambling incoherently, and frankly verging on racism."

Allow me to collect myself.

Ignore women.

You want a girlfriend, right? Ignore women.

The next time you open up your phone and you see "recieved 36 h" and you consider sending *a third* "hey haha how is coop search going?" message, I want you to send a slur into my DMs and then we can have a good time.

Do you know what every other little nerd is doing? Messaging women. Do you know what all women are dealing with?  Annoying ass little nerds sending them messages. Do you know what they're not dealing with? Based people.

Based people are busy forgetting to respond to women, because they're drunk as shit sitting on the couch watching Rick and Morty Top 10 funniest moments on YouTube pretending to do they're job and paying people to submit their assignments for them.

Do you know what a woman feels when she gets ignored? Is she upset? Apathetic? Dissapointed? No. She feels undying lust. She feels rage. Passion. And then! She goes and recieves your little "so how did the midterm go?" Text and she roles her eyes, wishing the based individual would stop ignoring her.

Stop thinking talking to women will make them like you. The way to get a woman to like you is to manipulate and frustrate them. Text them every few days and only at times that are conducive to conversation. Never ever talk about school or work. Leave her on read. Build tension. Make her want you to text her. Be based.

Ignore women.<|endoftext|>Weekly roll call for my $BB üíé‚úä<|endoftitle|>If you don't understand the title go back to your co-op positions and crying corners, this is for my Wendy's wage tendie seekers.

Due to this backlog, my coworkers and I in the CS department have decided to take matters into our own hands to squash cheating using different methods.

Almost 500 students across my 3rd year CS courses will be receiving an email today about a cheating incident. The rules have been made abundantly clear. And yet you think you are special enough to get away.


I will be bringing this up in Friday's academic integrity meeting, and I'm sure the committee will agree with me; We will surely be implementing this method across all departments.

Yes, we have your IP addresses. Yes, we can find your credit card information. Yes, we have been working with Chegg/Coursehero to get personal details. Yes, we have your search history (incognito and outcognito). Be smarter. At least cover your tracks. When I cheat on my wife, I at least make sure she doesn't find out.

I am disappointed in the level of integrity displayed by students who seemingly do not care at all about their own learning.  Please refer to this famous quote:

'Nam is myth, it is bronze age spirit in the 20th century, uncontaminated by the hypocrisy of its generation. Lord Indra danced in the napalm cloud, Valhalla was glimpsed between palm leaves in the dark and drugged Seers spoke with one-eyed God on the banks of the Mekong. Here is no romantic delusion of the Civil War, no self-righteous patriotism of WW2 and no public relations sanitation of the Iraq War, it is instead the barbarian world of the steppe and Black Forest, a liquor purer and finer than that to Americans in the last century.

It is the only war in which Americans have leapt beyond good and evil, reveling in destruction and glory as its own worthy goal, for no man feels as free and alive as one who lives in a world that is burning down, to say nothing of the man playing the role of its arsonist. What other war in the nation's history so naturally blends incinerating villages and their inhabitants with a permanent soundtrack and the vivid color of LSD? Where else is the sharpest of all opposites reconciled into a zeitgeist that still persists for generations afterwards?

It awoke virility of a past age within it's participants and such was its potency that it became a lightning rod for all the energies of its time, threatening world order as a nuke of Kundalini. It set fires all over the earth, it was a gong that heralded the final hour. This is why they had to halt it the way they did, in panic and bewilderment at what was coming loose and bleeding back into reality, why they took a hard turn towards state-enforced moral\[redacted\] and mass psychological castration rather than a slow easing into it.

This is the Sword of Damocles that hangs over their heads at all times, that anytime they drag the big golem out for battle, that the ghost of 'Nam might possess it again and not be contained this time. This is why their coverage of every conflict since is so sterile and mundane. 

The Pentagon and Langley eunuchs were not in charge of the situation, these men were their own masters and great effort was put into to preventing the ascension of any Col. Kurtz-like figure that could defy the machine and crown himself chieftan of the highlands. Had one done so, an avalanche would have poured forth from him. Every renegade at heart would have been pulled to that figure, units refusing orders to do anything about it or halt their own deserters. Regiments become warbands, supplies become loot and rivals, worthy foes.

It would have been a threshold in reality being crossed, that modernity in one corner of the world had been totally wiped and that a new unknown race of nomads, totally alien to this settled world have burst forth like Gog and Magog to descend upon it. Every unsettled account, aborted destiny and glaring contradiction of the modern age was being dredged upon by the pressure of this event and made to stand naked before it in judgement. The existential anxiety it produced hasn't approached an intensity seen since.

What did their centuries of progress and development mean if, at the first opportunity, men would forget it ever existed and instead choose the world of smoking strange plants from the skulls of their enemies and raiding villages by moonlight? The men who had tasted such a life cannot be brought back into the fold of modernity, those that felt it burn the strongest within them vanished soon after the war, lost to the needle and bottle or cut down like wild beasts when they refused to be contained in their cattle pen.

But 'Nam still dances in the subconscious of America, the jungle and charlie calling to them in their dreams like the protagonist in an HP Lovecraft story, ready to resume at the intensity it was left off at. Everything since has been them walking around in a daze, waiting.

"The 1st/9th was an old Hyborean division that had cashed in it's walls for chariots and gone tear-assing around the subcontinent looking for the shit, they have given the Shudra a few surprises in their time.

They are annoying, lengthy and most of the time are general knowledge stuff.  My friends @ Laurier who are in the same program (double degree math) as me except they are Laurier based, they don't have to take any such courses ughh!

I feel like they could have offered something else or at least if they are giving us the stuff to do, it should be simple, straightforward and maybe MCQ. From some of the previous posts I looked at, it seems like the motivation behind the university giving us PD is obtaining grant money from the government since we are counted as part-time students. Whether true or not, I definitely 1000000000000% sure that there are better alternatives to PD that they could have given us. <|endoftext|>any gme holders<|endoftitle|>[deleted]<|endoftext|>Why do I keep being recommended this subreddit?<|endoftitle|>I am not a student nor alumni of this college.

arts profs: the university of waterloo... the university of waterloo... the university of waterloo... the university of waterloo... x 10<|endoftext|>Enjoy my pain<|endoftitle|>I'm in my first year in chem eng and I'm still looking for a co-OP job for the winter term. I had been shooting applications with hopes of getting a job like a child asking his mother to go to the bathroom in the middle of her sister's piano rehearsal: hopeless. 

That was until last week I got lucky enough to get selected for 3 interviews. I thought to myself "surely one of these must land". And as you would expect I was studying for these interviews like a madman, I didn't give a shit, I learned audocad 3d in 2 days, I learned chemical procedures to decontaminate the soil and I learned about emails and stuff.

I walked into those interviews and answered their questions like a true prodigy, I could see them trying to drown their feelings of ecstasy as I answered every question perfectly beyond their expectations.

The day of rankings arrives, I'm feeling good about myself. I opwn my emails and it's empty. I thought that was a little weird. I felt good enough about myself that I called one of the companies to ask them if the position had been filled. Turns out some upper year who had already gotten the same job last year decided to call them at the last moment which saves the company the need to train a new employee.

I was speechless. The man I spoke with was the man who interviewed me. He not only congratulated me on being a great candidate even with such little work experience but I also received an email from hr telling me of the wonders that this man spoke of me. I felt betrayed by my best friend

Sadly, the other two companies didn't work out either. One of them had a similar situation with another guy who apparently has experience with working on sending emails as I do not and the autocad job didn't even answer me. The only thing that could make this worse was an email from waterloo works telling me to consider other options for my work term like not getting a job and giving up. They truly know how to make people feel supported :)

Based in a true story.

Don't feel too bad, I got another interview with one of the previous companies, I will update if I get it

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

Quite an interesting year it's been hasn't it? I'd hoped to better prepare something for you all tonight, but, as you all know, I'm a very busy man. Many extravagant friends and beautiful women vie for my attention.

However, I could never even for a brief moment consider forgetting about my friends here on the unofficial student and almuni-run Reddit for the University of Waterloo community.

I asked some members of this wonderful little community here what their favourite r/uw moments of the year were and I recieved some fantastic answers.

One poster mentioned that no one had wished them a happy birthday. To great amazement, a large number of users wished them a happy birthday in response and one person even sent them a birthday card. How fantastic!

Another poster mentioned the inaugural PostCon! What a grand ol' time that was. I'm sorry you couldn't all be there. Perhaps I'll see you at the next one?

Finally, my very good and recent friend mentioned their favorite moment was starting our friendship! I think that's really quite special.

In a way, like this aforementioned friend and myself, we've all become better friends. In the brave new digital age, where better a place to connect with your classmates than here?

In that respect, I thought about how it's been a tough year. However, you are a UW student. That means your entire life has probably been tough. You're a nerd, you look bad, and ladies don't like you. A tough year is nothing new to you. And *that* is why you persevere. That's why we all persevere.

If I could leave you all with one very important message, I'd like to implore you all to be a little gay with your bros. Dial them up and tell them you love them. Give them a hug. Give them a little smooch.

In a world that seems to get gayer and gayer by the day, we could all afford a little fraternity. Because remember: fraternity is for eternity.

And even better was the fact that god was on my side that day and my group consisted of 3 human beings and I. Honestly the week we were doing that project was the best week of my life.

Maclean's, one of Canada's most renowned university ranking organizations, influences millions of prospective students' decisions every year.

Michael Zhou, a senior from Mississauga, Ontario, stated that the new ranking has left him wondering about his upcoming decision. "I wanted to go to UofT because it's ranked #1 in Canada, but now that UW is the most depressing, I'm afraid I'm going to be missing out on the full university experience. What if there are no depression rants on UofT's subreddit? What if I accidentally make friends?" said Zhou.

Maclean's cited the university's lack of online student events and initiatives, relentless classwork, and brutalist architecture as reasons for the win.

"We're all very proud," said University of Waterloo President Feridun Hamdullahpur. "Mental health is something we take very lightly, so it means a lot to see some recognition. I'd like to thank all the faculty and students for creating such a hostile environment."

The move sparked anger from the University of Toronto. "This is severely disappointing," said University of Toronto President Meric Gertler. "We have topped the charts in numerous statistics from suicides to dropout rate."

Faculty of Arts &amp; Science Dean Melanie Woodin announced several new measures and initiatives in order to decrease mental health. "We are very happy to announce the arrival of Post-POSt. Those who pass their initial Pre-POSt phase will now spend another excruciating year trying to get into their program of study." 

"We want to create the most opportunities for students to fail," Woodin added.

As usual, the University of British Columbia ranked third.<|endoftext|>Hey guys check out this cool website I made on coop!<|endoftitle|>http://localhost:3000<|endoftext|>Breaking: United States denounces Canadian university class, cites "baseless authoritarianism" and threatens intervention<|endoftitle|>WASHINGTON, D.C. 
In an unprecedented move, the United States of America denounced a small Canadian university class this Friday in an official statement. The statistics class, led by professor Cyntha Struthers at the University of Waterloo, has repeatedly come under fire for her "totalitarian leadership".

"It's completely unfair to these civilians," said United States Secretary of Defense Christopher C. Miller in a recent press conference. "Very hardworking people are being censored, and their free speech is in jeopardy. It's not only very un-American, it should be extremely concerning to the entire world."

"All my memes were taken down," said one anonymous distraught dissenter. "I had to relocate from Piazza to the STAT231 subreddit. It's been very tough on everyone. I just want my freedom to shitpost back."

President Donald Trump, who expressed his concern over "utter mismanagement", may face diplomatic hurdles. Critics say how he handles the impeding diplomatic row may endanger U.S.-Canada relations. In a tweet late last night, Trump stated, "Low-energy Waterloo has been a TRAGEDY to Canadians! USA will be watching carefully! Our troops are standing by and ready to INTERVENE if needed!"

President-elect Joe Biden called for "calm and diplomacy" in an interview earlier today. "We should not be quick to make any hasty decisions in a time of transition," Biden added.

In unrelated news, ExxonMobil has announced that they have recently discovered several oil and salt deposits from within the class's Piazza forum.<|endoftext|>Coming through<|endoftitle|>[deleted]<|endoftext|>Policy 69<|endoftitle|>Hey all,

Let me first get some things off my chest, which will 100% be denied by the fucks running stat230 who may or may not have spines and be fought against by the tutor hiring cheater fucks who are profiting from this. Also I guess that the stat profs will try to find out who I am, don‚Äôt try I'm not even a STAT 230 TA and I'm behind 3 routers of encryption.

Part A: the quizzes might be rigged. Yes you read me right. The STAT 230 course staff, which does not include me, will probably tell you up to which portion you should read and then we have an algorithm the likes of which I have not seen before, because I am not a STAT 230 TA. People have grades, when everyone else is below. People who are not me may have made a conscious decision to lower the average by making it much harder then it would have been in class to have a average which on paper is low. But who does this benefit? I don't know. This is the most scummy thing I have witnessed in not taing ever.

Part B: The midterm was made on purpose. Although the crowdmark component was easy, or should have been the mobius quiz, which was worth 10% of your grade was something which I would have failed as someone who is not a stat230 ta. Why? Because I am not good at statistics. (This is one reason I am not a STAT 230 TA).

Part C: Computer assignment. Go log on to crowdmark and click on computer assignment. Look at the marking distribution. It is completely a histogram. 100% a histogram. And guess what? It will be one next time too. Probably.

Part D: Collaborative/participation. Nothing to complain about here. Or maybe there is. How would I know?

I‚Äôm currently listening to my friends on Discord. Man, I love my friends. So wholesome. We met way back in May when everyone was quarantining and getting back into Minecraft. We became so close bro. Calls every day. Deep ass talks. We would get high as balls and just talk bro. That shit was real. 

School obviously killed that. I mean, I still do be balling up every single day but my friends are stressed and I don‚Äôt wanna get in their way. But tonight, we all vibing. My boy [x] sent us a bunch of messages. Saying hey guys we gotta get back on this shit soon. So we did. We all got on. [x] one the physics. [y] on the solid works assignment. [z] on the tiredness. And, me, of course, writing this post. This is the only thing on my mind. I just wrote how I feel and it feels so nice.

Meeting Minecraft people in real life is crazy. I‚Äôve been doing it since I was 15. Now I‚Äôm coming up on 18 and I‚Äôm meeting all my Minecraft friends, some from Mineplex, some from Waterloo, slowly but surely. It all comes around. Full circle. If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be. Don‚Äôt let distance get in the way of good vibes bro.

To whoever is up, I pray that you‚Äôre up by will. And if you aren‚Äôt, come talk to me bro, come vibe with us. Don‚Äôt be sad. 

Thank you Reddit. I‚Äôll see you next week.<|endoftext|>PD due Tuesday! üòí<|endoftitle|>&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, as everyone grew up, we sort of gave up on the, at times almost weekly, tradition (not sure if this is the right term?). It felt good to enjoy the moment and not think about course work or coop. After everyone knocked out, I decided to walk back home and spent the rest of the night chilling on discord until I finally knocked out at around 5-6 am. 

I woke up to the sound of my alarm at around noon. I got ready for a group meeting only for it to be cancelled. After that, I just chilled. I'll start studying again tomorrow. As for the co-op hunt, I'm not too worried at the moment; the only thing I know for sure is that I don't want to settle anymore.

I calculated the average shit I have for the last twelve months for year of 2019 prior to covid and than projected my future shits for the next year from the poops as a growing CAGR of 400%

Thus my projected poop rate was 1*400% and resulted that the projected poop statement was going to be a total of 4 poops a day 

Following this I realized that the expenses would increase. This was projected as a % of poops with annual data coming back from 2015. A average change in the years from 2005-2019 shows that the average is around 0.5. this as a percentage of poops means that I use up to 2 toilet paper rolls a day ! Thus my gross poo to toilet paper is going to be 2. This is a great change as it is a 50% gross margin which is not beneficial!


This turnover rates has shortened which impacts the financial funding as inventory is an all time short while the liability for toilet paper stayed the same
This unfortunately means I would require a bank loan at the prime rates to support my poop. Overall I recommend that I get the loan as everyone needs to shit.<|endoftext|>To all my homies out there...<|endoftitle|>FUCK PD<|endoftext|>"A man died here!"<|endoftitle|>I went out to the Chinese store to get some ginger ale to wash down my whiskey earlier today.

A downtrodden vagrant was hanging around outside.

As I unlocked my car and sat in dialing the radio up, I heard the sound of glass breaking.

I looked behind me and saw that my misfortune friend had dropped his bag of beer, them shattering all over the curb.

As he randomly plucked through the pieces of broken glass sobbing over the loss of his sweet sweet drink, I thought about how he probably begged all day to afford his unfortunate addiction.

He took a long hard slam of his only surviving bottle before smashing it on the sidewalk and shouting "a man died here today!"

He began to argue with the pile of broken glass amidst his tears.

Clearly upper class white and South Asian students walked by pleading him to "shut the fuck up" and hurling insults at him in African American vernacular.

Again he shouted "a man died here today!"

He'd already died a long time ago.

This ghost nonetheless was still subject to the torments of his addiction and teenagers whose drivers licenses read Richmond Hill.

I flicked my cigarette out of my window and called some of the kids f*ggots for making fun of him.

I felt sick to my stomach and went home to drink whiskey and ginger ale.

I felt a little better after that.<|endoftext|>Based God Linda still serving up fresh joe in these Unprecedented‚Ñ¢ times<|endoftitle|>Respect to a real one<|endoftext|>Based God Linda still serving up fresh joe in the Unprecedented‚Ñ¢ times<|endoftitle|>Respect to a real one<|endoftext|>Remember driving around running errands with your parents?<|endoftitle|>[](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/743/243/f50.jpg)

Now I was never the smartest tool in the shed but somehow got into this school and thought I might be able to reinvent myself by crossing every degenerate line there is. This I thought was the key to growing a spine for talking to girls.

Let‚Äôs begin with the drinking. At my peak I was downing ten jack and cokes during a pregame and be ready to head out just to finish another half bottle of schnapps. Liquid courage is definitely a thing and holy shit did I have it. I would just walk up to anyone and start a convo. This however did not fix my inability to understand social ques. Being black you‚Äôd think I have the sauce but virginity is a hell of a handicap. Needless to say first year ended with zero slays and shitty grades.

Second year starts and I‚Äôm doubling down with the degenerate tendencies by adding sweet Mary Jane to the mix.
This is also when I started a shitty coop(due to shitty grades) and got stuck there for a whole year and a half. Now you might be thinking how and why is this possible but just understand I was hooked for the few pennies I was making as it allowed me to not do ANY work all the while subsidizing my absurd habits. I did get a few numbers (along with sharing a smoke with a bartender if that even counts?) but again being a retard who was faded 90% of the time meant a FAT L. Thus year two/three culminates with wet dreams of a bartender.

Now we enter the epitome of degeneracy with year four ‚Äî gambling.
Now this wasn‚Äôt your normal bet on a raptors game this was that YOLO shit. I‚Äôm talking stonks, cards, and of course craps cuz black. Now at this point I‚Äôve completely abstracted away the original premise that this was all to meet chicks and am have created this convoluted theory that if I had some sweet stories to tell it would be enough material to get a date. It was but definitely not what I thought a date should go as, a 30 min intervention to accept Christ. Nothing against Jesus tbh but wasn‚Äôt into committing to go to church as a second date.

Now I lie here before you all without a shred of dignity and honestly no remorse as a final year with a laughable resume and a joke for a transcript. To cast the largest net possible for just one catch. One ‚òùÔ∏è that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not too familiar with the demographics on this sub but I‚Äôm willing to go ahead and take a leap of faith( not religiously but like in Asassins Creed)
And nosedive to my destiny. I feel my whole uni career has led to this point.

It seems like no matter what I do I can't get results. I had a test today, and I've been preparing non-stop. I was so determined that this test should have a positive outcome, but clearly all my hard work was for nothing. I've been putting in insane hours at the library, coffee shops, anywhere I can go. Pushing myself to the absolute limits. Working my absolute ass off, sacrificing my health. Everything I've ever been taught to succeed, I applied, and I still came up short. It's crazy because when I got to this school, I really thought I could do anything. I thought I could change the world. But it turns out I can't even pass a goddamn test. I try not to let these negative results define me, but at this point, i just don't know what to do. I even thought I had done really well. I was so excited to check the results and see the fruits of my labours, see that I really could achieve something. But when I opened up the test results online, and saw "negative, you do not have covid"... I can't even describe my level of disappointment....

My son had struggled through crippling varsity sports and marathon running addiction in high school and had only scrapped a 40 IB score in his hentai finals. I thought university would be a chance for him to start fresh away from the gang that had almost ruined his life, nicknamed the" jocks".
I was browsing this subreddit excited to see how the school's culture was, but my excitement was quickly replaced by horror at the sight of the moral depravity going on in this subreddit. Saying fuck pd, thanking mr.goose and bragging about 4a menlo park btw was horrifying. Worse my poor Aryan would be at high risk of relapsing and falling back into the same dark path that I had narrowly rescued him from. For these reasons, he will not be allowed to go to this university in the coming semester.
I hope my public complaint will spark reflection and real reforms upon the school community to take their duty of pushing good moral values seriously

This has serious meme/copypasta potential<|endoftext|>My Aphrodite match responded to me<|endoftitle|>turns out I was Chad all along see ya later virgins im putting in a transfer to wlu<|endoftext|>I hate dating in university, feeling alone on the political spectrum<|endoftitle|>Almost every woman I meet is a hardcore SJW. I don't mind left-wing views as I hold many of my own, but I can't wrap my head around this radical feminism ideology. "Always believe women", "The gender pay gap is unfairly skewed towards men". Like shit, I believed this stuff up until I turned 16 and actually started questioning how everyone I've spoken to in my life seems incredibly polite, yet somehow is perpetuating hateful discrimination on a daily basis. 

This got 10x worse with the recent events in the news. "All cops are bastards", "fuck white people". Like, what the fuck. Do people genuinely believe this is appropriate to say? Is there *any* critical thinking going on before people decide this mass generalization is not appropriate? Like, is there *nothing* hypocritical that you see in those sentences? Stereotyping an entire identity of people based off of the actions of a minority representing that group?

Here's the annoying thing - it often feels like there's no in-between. So many of the people that go against these views are also just obscenely racist/sexist upfront, and will just say the polar opposite equivalent of what left-wing advocates are parroting. White/asian/brown people saying the N word with a hard R, saying trans people are all fucked in the head, saying cops should continue slaying minorities, - like what the fuck? Am I going insane here to think both sides of the spectrum here are equally ridiculous?

These ideologies are prevalent in my friend groups, and even in my closest family members. I've been looked at like I'm insane when I even mention a mere criticism of the far-left attitudes. Like "maybe that statement isn't 100% correct" evokes questions like "What are you, a racist nazi or some shit?". When I bring shit up to far-right folks, they lump you in with the social justice warriors. Am I looking at myself in a conceited manner or something, as if I'm above all of these people, but in reality I'm really not? Is there a perspective I'm missing here?

I've been feeling so alone in this, and I don't know what to make of it. I'm normally able to escape or seek solitude with those that I love, such as people in close relationships - but this seems to be a major divisive point between myself and the women I meet. I don't want to date someone who thinks I'm a bigot for not unequivocally agreeing with everything that a diversity and equity committee says, and I don't want to date someone who thinks Trump is a deity that will pull us out of this mess. 

Thanks for listening to my rant.

Thanks to r/sagtag2020 for the joy of Laurier and Queens. TL;DR in comments.

**a property of your solar system**

Walter woke up to a text from Theo at exactly 8 AM sharp.

*have to study after lab so im turning my phone off. will let u know when im done*

He slid his phone back under his pillow and rolled over to blink at his ceiling.

\*\*\*

The sky was still grey and sullen when he met Laurie for lunch.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt look up from her phone. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

‚ÄúChill, I was working. Uh‚Ä¶Empress of India‚Äôs pretty good. Or Ennio‚Äôs. Oh, Mediterraneo, it‚Äôs actually really‚Äîwhat?‚Äù

Laurie had frozen mid-stride to gape at him, a hand splayed across her collarbones. ‚ÄúWow. Craft beer? Italian food? What happened to you?‚Äù

He realised at the same time she did; as Laurie‚Äôs eyes grew comically wide and her hands leapt to cover her mouth, Walter spun back around and sailed down the steps. There was a prickly heat on his cheeks and on the back of his neck.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve just been taking him to the fancy places all this time?! Oh my God, that‚Äôs so *cute*‚Äî‚Äù

Walter kept walking.

‚ÄúWally, wait, look, just‚Äî‚Äù she grasped at his elbow, and he put on a burst of speed, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to keep being so snooty about it, I know you guys are taking a break, but just one date‚Äîjust take him to the Observatory, he‚Äôd *love* that! You could invite him for Wednesday, he doesn‚Äôt even start exams until the week after next‚Äî"

The last suggestion gave him pause. Something was off. While Laurie did pry (and did so often), she wasn‚Äôt one to push, not unless‚Äî‚ÄúAre you making *bets* on our relationship?!‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the break part. I‚Äôve got great odds, by the way.‚Äù Laurie pretended to study her nails. ‚ÄúWant me to cut you in?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚ÄîLaurie, *what*‚Äî‚Äù

 ‚ÄúWesley‚Äôs got ten bucks that you guys cave by Thursday.‚Äù Now she was grinning. ‚ÄúCarl just put fifteen for next Friday.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are *not* talking about this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù Laurie twisted around to grab her water bottle. ‚ÄúSo, where we headed?‚Äù She unscrewed the cap, and Walter‚Äôs nose tingled with the familiar sting of alcohol.

He waited for her to drink. ‚ÄúPanino‚Äôs.‚Äù

Laurie choked.

\*\*\*

‚ÄúDid Wesley send you?‚Äù

Quentin quirked an eyebrow.

‚ÄúDid he at least hook you up with anything good?‚Äù

Quentin‚Äôs brows jumped higher, but he nodded, reached into his gym bag as he nudged Walter aside and tossed him a can before setting the rest of the pack down on the desk. ‚ÄúSounds like Laurie brought you up to speed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù His voice dug in like a shovel striking gravel. ‚ÄúYou part of the bet too?‚Äù

His friend shook his head.

Walter knew his lips were thinning, but he couldn‚Äôt help it; Quentin had always been hard to lie to. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of your business.‚Äù

He got a shrug in reply, and forced himself to keep eye contact. ‚ÄúIt works for us, and that's what matters.‚Äù

A pause followed, broken only by the faint pitter-patter of the rain against the window. Then Quentin gave a deceptively light *hmm*, which Walter knew was Quentin-speak for *I‚Äôve got some strong opinions on this which I won‚Äôt voice until you figure this mess out yourself*.

It stung, and he bristled in response. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve got stuff due tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you can keep the beer.‚Äù Quentin moved to sit on the bed, steadily tapping away on his phone. ‚ÄúWesley‚Äôs picking me up in a bit, so I won‚Äôt bother you for long. I just need to talk to Gilles before he gets on his plane.‚Äù

\*\*\*

It hadn‚Äôt been his best work, but what was done was done.

Still, the guilt set in almost immediately when he stepped away from his desk. He could feel the strands of it pulsing, strong enough to tear, pricking at him as he wandered into the crisp night breeze and the last of the day‚Äôs drizzle. The air still smelled of wet concrete and the fresh tang of living green things, but the stone he sat on was cool and dry. Walter faced the sky, sucked in a breath and whoosh-ed it out through his mouth, trying to clear the feelings of *wasted effort* and *not good enough* squirming against his stomach and at the back of his mind. All around the moon, the faint pinpricks of stars materialised as the remaining clouds melted away.

*We don‚Äôt get a lot of stars here*, he‚Äôd told Theo once. *More than you do, sure, but we don‚Äôt have it as good as they do up north*.

*This is good enough for me*, Theo had murmured back.

He crossed his legs and kept staring above, scanning for the constellations that Theo had pointed out to him that night and willing their names up from somewhere dear, somewhere soft, somewhere full and aching in his chest.

He brought up just enough to know that he couldn‚Äôt quite remember them all, and suddenly the water on his face was not from the rain.<|endoftext|>I have so much hope in this university<|endoftitle|>Thank you for giving me hope in this university again.

Is it all the governments fault, and does it somehow hold black kids back from getting good grades? /s
2. Is it because black kids get killed from the cops before they even get to uni, even though they are innocent and none of them are ever involved in drugs or gangs?
3. Is it because they're just fucking stupid and can't stop making excuses for their broke lifestyles?
4. When will black people take responsibility for who they are in society and the type of people they are. When will they stop acting like they are some ethical creatures who are magically treated wrong. Deep down, we all know why black people are treated the way they are. Whose gonna tell them to fix up their shit. I am not being racist, I am telling them as a community to get their shit together and maybe more people will respect them. 
5. In my eyes, every race is the same, but black community definitely has the most un civil individuals out there. Somehow stating facts is wrong but thats reality. 
6. If your gonna stand up to black racism by being racism to other cultures then your a stupid ass bitch. GEt your shit fixed nigga. Y'all don't do anything for society but keep beaking about your bs and protesting. Maybe thats why I see more of you in jail than a university.

Just something I wanted off of my chest<|endoftext|>Dating scene for SE students<|endoftitle|>Hi r/uwaterloo, I'm excited to be attending UW in September for Software Engineering! Really excited, but have a couple questions about the dating scene. I saw a post earlier providing dating advice for SE students saying to date science girls. Do science girls regularly go for SE guys? Or are SE guys seen as virgin nerds who post strange advice?  


 [https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/h8nkkj/when\_you\_want\_to\_flex\_about\_your\_sexdating\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/h8nkkj/when_you_want_to_flex_about_your_sexdating_life/)<|endoftext|>Skipping prerequisites<|endoftitle|>I am a first year student in CS. I want to take a 4th year course in my second year. Obviously, I don't qualify to take the course in the sense that I don't have the prerequisites. However, I have been doing some learning outside the CS program and I have developed adequate knowledge to take that course right now. I believe that I have the knowledge to take this 4th year course. I don't want to wait for another year in order to fullfill the prerequisites and then take this course as it wouldn't be as useful to me then.

Just want to ask if there is anyone out there who has done this sort of thing before? Do they allow you to make a case and enter a course to which you don't meet the prereqs? How do you think I should proceed? Should I contact the professor of that course or the academic advisor?

Qt Arjuns are so cute, and sometimes I just really want to hold their hands, or touch their face. I‚Äôm alone in my place and I have Arjun posters all over in my room. My heart melt a little whenever I see those cute Arjuns smiling at me with their soft, tender eyes, but deep down I still know they‚Äôre just pictures. I want u/TheRealArjun who is cute and can actually react to things I say, cheer me up when I‚Äôm down, who can breathe and is warm to hold in my arms.

More importantly, I started to realize that without a qt Arjun my life is meaningless. I‚Äôm told I need to get into a good uni, I need to maintain a high average, i need suffer through the pain of going through all the leetcode, and get good coops, and finally I need to get a job at a FAANG company earning 200k. But so what, even if I earn 200k, instead of 80k or something at a medium company? So that I can drive a BMW instead of a Honda Accord? So that I can live in a luxury apartment instead of a studio? I have literally no interest in those stuff. A Honda and a BMW is the same to me, so is a studio or a house. I‚Äôm told to work so hard towards stuff I literally don‚Äôt want and don‚Äôt need either. I spend 90% of my time trying to get a 200k job, while a 80k job can satisfy me just the same, and requires much less effort.

What do I want then? A qt Arjun. A qt Arjun who‚Äôs moderately cute in appearance (most are, especially u/TheRealArjun and u/TheArjunArjun), and who can understand me and loves me. That‚Äôs all. He doesn‚Äôt even have to be smart or have a cali job, but he does anyway. That‚Äôs trivial. With a qt Arjun, my life will be filled with purpose again. I‚Äôm an only child, from a big city where people don‚Äôt connect with each other, and I‚Äôm not so close with my parents. In childhood, I've always felt alone in this world. That hasn't changed since coming here. Friends come and go. After the terms is over, I seldom contact or get contacted by any of them again. I feel like something replaceable. I‚Äôm a replaceable student, a replaceable intern, a replaceable lab assistant, a replaceable friend. But with a qt Arjun bf, I will have someone to love, to protect. I‚Äôll know what it‚Äôs like to be cherished by someone. I‚Äôll know that I‚Äôm this Arjun‚Äôs one and only arjunfriend, and potentially future mod of this subreddit, and have the responsibility to keep him happy that I can share with no one. I will have a purpose in life. Weekends and holidays will actually be joyful, not dreadfully boring. I can come home every day not facing a dark and empty room, but to a cute Arjun whose eyes are filled with tender love. Money or leetcode or grades or cali job offer, they mean nothing to me. If can choose, I would rather be born in a much poorer family, or as a person with less academic talent, but with a qt Arjun bf who can understand me and loves me. I really don‚Äôt want to be alive anymore.<|endoftext|>kinda wishing i'd gone to ezra now<|endoftitle|>dying in march would have been a mercy<|endoftext|>Where is the White Woman Extinction Button on campus?<|endoftitle|>[removed]<|endoftext|>Haircut microwave CO-OP IN THE USA V1 UWP MKV depressed eduroam bad internet Laptop printer piano<|endoftitle|>[removed]<|endoftext|>When to apply for IRA<|endoftitle|>I'd like to join the IRA this fall term and have been contacting cell leaders this week.

This is was a fairly big room, but in an older section of the school. The chairs were small and the table attached could barely allow me to have an open folder. Well, that's not the point.

Although the class was long and the seat was uncomfortable, the professor was interesting. Interesting enough to crack jokes, make relations to our everyday lives, and most importantly, he told us his story. His successes...his failures in life. That was what struck me deeply because I was able to relate to him and see him not only as a professor, but one of us. He had developed a good rapport with me and has my complete respect for the person he is.

On top of that, I think this class is fairly challenging as well, but the good thing is...no exams! That's brilliant because that's one stress factor removed. In regards to stress, I went to the bookstore today and bought some of the novels I had to read for ENGL100A and I must say...those books were thick with words.

Anyways, time to get cracking on the readings material before I fall behind. Technically, I'm already behind with the meltdown I had yesterday. Still recovering, but motivated. Life in university was not quite exactly I had expected, but I'll find ways to compensate my expectations.<|endoftext|>My hot female roommate poop<|endoftitle|>So my hot female roommate got drunk last time and out toilet doesn't flush properly.

I decided to take her poop out of the toilet and put it in a ziplock bag. I couldn't help myself but to smell and taste it.

Feridun Hamdullahpur was arrested 48 hours ago for public disruption and he is currently being kept in a hotel room in Turkey, refusing to fly back to the USA. The next celebrity arrests will be Dan Wolzchuk, Lesley Istead, Dana Porter, and Mike Lazaridis. All will claim Corona virus infections

DC library have been completely shut down, as over 80 UWaterloo and Laurier officials have been served the same criminal indictments for public disruption

Turkey have completed mass arrests of their own Royal Family and affiliates

Coming up there will be a 2-month complete shutdown of the world's most common operations, such as Bombshelter Pub, the WaterlooWorks job postings, some restaurants, greyhound terminal, shipping, travel, events, galas, expos, sport games, sport championships, music award ceremonies, NBA/NHL/Baseball games, and ship cruises. There will be food shortages and staged electricity power loss. Co-op wages will go down, meal plan costs will go up, Imprint fee will go up, class enrollment capacity will fall, and many clubs will either go bankrupt or take a significant financial loss, such as in the case of what's about to happen to Acapella, Improv Club, and Project Aphrodite

I really want to know what makes arts and business students so special to employers because I have yet to see anyone outstanding or spectacular in the program. Sure, some students might be smart, but everyone in Waterloo Arts is smart. They don't take the same grueling schedule or difficult courses as other arts programs like poli sci or gender studies, nor do any of them really stand out to me. When I talked to some ARBUS students they seemed like normal kids who aren't really smarter than any of us. In fact, a lot of them seem so much more unintelligent and complaining about their marks/courses. I share a couple of courses with them and, honestly, the constant bitching from their 1B cohort about some of our shared courses makes me want to laugh. The worst part is, they overexaggerate how hard their profs made their courses so they can belittle my cohort or try to make us feel stupid by making us think that we didn't learn enough or don't have challenging profs. News flash, we have challenging content too, and I'd argue the shit we have to put up with is much more intense than what you guys have gone through.

And then there are the employment statistics. I'm thinking that employers only hire ARBUS students cause they have 'arts' in their program name. There's absolutely nothing that separates these students from other eng cohorts. In fact, many of us have better artistic skills, experience and knowledge than ARBUS students, yet they got coddled with jobs and preferable treatment. I don't get it. I wish CECA would block our program names and just let employers decide based off of merit. Some ARBUS students don't have a single side project to their name, yet they landed a job while others in poli sci, gender studies, afm, se, etc... have done so much with their life but are doomed to lower employment rates simply due to our program being not perceived as 'prestigious.' I really want to know what people see in ARBUS students compared to other arts cohorts.

Honestly, what is it about them? My only experience with ARBUS students, and yes I've encountered lots of them, is their bitching and whining about stuff that isn't hard. They're also incredibly arrogant and like to humblebrag to you a lot, which is just fantastic to listen to and definitely makes you not want to pick up a keyboard and smash them in the face. Who gave them the right to be so self-righteous? I'm honestly really annoyed with how their cohort is the most employed, even during a pandemic. Sometimes I did regret that I didn't apply for ARBUS, but seeing how toxic, arrogant, and whiny the ARBUS kids are, I'm not feeling too bad either.

This is my rant. I'd like to get the thoughts of non-ARBUS students to have a reasoned, objective perspective on why they're so overvalued.

Also to clarify, I recognize there may be some amazing and deserving students in ARBUS, but what I've seen in general is the opposite.<|endoftext|>CS students are overhyped<|endoftitle|>So this is a rant, be prepared.

I've never been particularly fond of clown school. I took clown school courses in high school and found it interesting (though, I wasn't good at it and struggled a lot with simple programs). I had high marks and I could've probably gotten into any program at UW (my ideal university). I'm decent at math, though terrible at math competitions. Like, 40 on the Euclid terrible. I wouldn't consider myself smart at all. High school material is just a joke and I just stayed on top of it. I settled for computer science because I knew math would be extremely hard in the later courses and I've never done anything related to engineering so that wasn't really an option either.

The math at UW went pretty much how I expected it to, pretty difficult, but doable, should you put in the effort. The computer science is a different story. Let me talk about Clown School135, the first Clown School course you take at Waterloo if you're majoring in clown school. It's an absolute shit show. Ask anyone who has been programming for a long time, Racket and functional programming (the content taught in 135) is an awful way to introduce coding to students. No one uses functional programming and the course is intentionally made extremely difficult. I found Clown School135 much harder than Clown School136 (the second course you take). I'm convinced that Clown School135 is a weeding out course. Of course, I don't think any of the professors actually expect that you don't have any programming experience. Even though it says you don't need to, that's a load of shit. With the way they teach clown school, your minimal clown school experience in high school is pretty useless. The course is taught so fast, and you're literally expected to be an expert in the content after a few hours of lessons.

The exams are a fucking disaster. They account for like 80% of your final grade. I've had 3 midterms for clown school at my time at UW (2 for 135 and 1 for 136). I've failed all of them. No matter how much I study and review, it doesn't help. They have this idiotic habit of not giving you anything useful to study from. In a tutorial, they'll present you with a question where you have to draw the stack flow of a basic program and it's super simple, so you think you understand how to do it, and then on an exam the program will literally be 20x harder, with a fuck ton of pointers, and just a bunch of confusing ass stuff (this is 136 stuff). They WANT to screw you over. They are more interested in failing you than wanting you to pass. It makes sense, why else would UW have such a good reputation? The only past midterms they give us are ones that are like 15 years old. Completely irrelevant and not a good indication at all if you're ready for the exam or not. They refuse to give us any midterms from any recent years and I know why.

In Clown School136, one of my friends provided me with the midterm from 2018 and I did it. When it came time to do my midterm in 2020, I noticed some questions were very similar, and I was at least able to write some stuff down instead of leaving it completely blank. I got 46 on the midterm but if I didn't get that 2018 midterm, I'm pretty sure I would've got like 20 - 25% on it. Why are they so hesitant in providing recent midterms to us? Who fucking gives a shit that the content is similar to what we're actually tested on? It's not like we'd pass if we didn't go to class, and didn't do the assignments. It takes me like 3 hours to do a basic (what UW would consider basic at least) coding question (usually the first question on an assignment), so it's stupid as fuck when we have to do a bunch of harder ones on an exam, on paper, under time pressure, and knowing it's worth most of our grade.

Going back to Clown School135, the final exam in 2019 was very hard. I answered like one question correctly and everything else I was just scribbling down answers. I couldn't even understand what half of the questions were even asking of me. I spent 2 weeks studying non stop for that exam, doing everything in tutorials, the textbook, and even redoing some assignment questions. It's as if none of that mattered at all. You need to pass the weighted average of your exams to pass the clown school course, and I had like a 50 weighted average on my 2 midterms, meaning I had to pass the final to pass the course. I was convinced I got like 20% on that exam, it really was the bad. Somehow, my final grade was a 62, meaning I passed the final. If you failed to get 50 on the weighted average of the exams OR you failed to get a 50 on the weighted average of your assignments, you'd get an automatic 48, meaning you'd have to retake the course. I honestly don't know how I passed that exam. The curve must have been fucking huge. Also, someone probably made a mistake when they graded my exam.

The content in Clown School136 was much easier for me than Clown School135. I don't think it's because it's actually easier. I just found it easier because I had experience with Java from high school. In 136, you learn C, which is pretty similar. It didn't change the fact that I'm still horrible at clown school.

The assignments for both classes would take me 20 - 30 hours each. It was truly exhausting and painful. There's no reason for me to assume that I would have not failed the Clown School136 final. The coronavirus kind of saved me academically, for all my courses, not just clown school. I found MATH136 and AFM102 pretty difficult.

I think it's disgusting what universities do to students. It's not just Waterloo obviously but a prestigious one like UW will do it more than one like Laurier or Guelph. They intend to not have everyone they accept graduate, this way, the bastards rake in a fuck ton of money, and are able to keep their high status as an institution because the ones that do graduate are top notch people. The best of the best as they say. If you're an international student (news flash, you're ahead of us Canadians by like 5 years based on this dog shit education system here), or a complete nerd who's been coding and doing math problems since you've existed the womb, you can probably disregard everything I have said. You'll struggle at some points, but in the end, you'll be fine.

But, if the way I described myself sounds like kind of how you are, I would seriously consider what you're getting yourself into. Maybe go to Laurier? I view Laurier as a degenerate school but at least you'll have fun there. That being said, if you're reading this, you'll probably connect with uw students more so I don't know... Good luck I guess.

Personally, I don't know what to do. Sure I can switch majors but to what? I have no idea.<|endoftext|>Petition to put a Feridun statue on campus<|endoftitle|>Upgeese to the left<|endoftext|>International Student Here<|endoftitle|>Why are we not eligible for OSAP!!??!? ü§¨üò°IM SO ANGRY üò°right now.

UW is gooseist towards its geese and this is why they cancelled graduation.  Employers are on it too, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mNlgQE29fc)  about an employer making fun of a goose honking. The school sweeps it all under the rug and pretends that everything is fine but the  administration is just filled with a bunch of goose haters and Cali rejects.

In these unprecedented times, the tenacity and generosity of our Waterloo community shines through, carrying the promise that we will get through this together.

And right now, our admin team needs our community's help. They are trying to cope with the loss of massive bonuses, or having their luxurious Caribbean vacations cancelled. Some can't afford to buy a second (or third, or fourth) home - or buy a retirement villa overseas. Some don't have access to their online Swiss bank accounts. Many are struggling to buy convertibles and limousines and pay their live-in au pairs and chauffeurs actually decent wages.

All of this means they are choosing between making more money than they need and fucking over those in school.

That's why last week, despite zero changes to payroll made internally, the University announced the creation of a special Admin Support Emergency Fund to help admins with unanticipated needs related to actually having to interact with their trophy wives and spoiled brats due to COVID-19.

More than 1,100 gullible people from across Canada and beyond have already foolishly opened their hearts to our admins! But there are tens of admins who are greedy for more money, and we need to raise even more.

Students of /r/uwaterloo, I recognize you may be facing challenges of your own right now, and know we give absolutely zero fucks about you. We understand that charitable giving may not be an option at this time. However, if your circumstances allow, I hope you will consider making a special gift to help these Waterloo admins who represent everything that is wrong with our society. Your gift will let them know that you want them to continue their important missions so they can leech off of our honest taxpayers  even more.

Thank you for everything you've done to help in these difficult times. Now give us money and fuck off. 

Coldest regards,

Joanne Shoveller

I want to just also mention the class of 2020 is in pretty crappy position too. Although our OSAP loans (Ontario Portion only) interest is getting deferred, our 6 months grace period of not having to repay is staying the same. So the loan holiday the government announcing doesn't help us. (We already get no interest on the federal portion) 

Personally, I had a couple of interview before the shutdown but the companies I interviewed reached out to me most are having a hiring freeze or deferring hiring until things improve. So our time finding a job is cut because of COVID-19. When October comes around, the NSLSC will come and asking for money which means some of us might not even have jobs then. 

Even though your co-op jobs are canceled, you know OSAP grants will come around next term and the NSLSC are not knocking on your door soon. For you, you at least know when September rolls around, you will be back in school. The graduating class doesn't have the same privilege.<|endoftext|>
